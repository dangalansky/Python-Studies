## ------------- The Shuffle Function ------------- ##

# we last left off with a list containing a set of randomly selected characters for a password
# unfortunately, it is still ordered, containing letters then numbers then symbols
# to further complicate our password, it would help to randomize the list

import random

random.shuffle(password)

# shuffle() is a function of the random module that randomizes items on a list

randomized_password = ""

for character in password:
	randomized_password += character

print(randomized_password)

# after we return a randomized list we need to convert that into a string
# much like how we created an empty list to populate in the last lesson, we will create an empty string
# using a 'for loop' we populate the string by iterating through the now-randomized list
