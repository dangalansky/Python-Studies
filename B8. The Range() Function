## ----------------- Using the Range() Function ----------------- ##

# 'for loops' can also use the range() function to dictate how many times a line of code will be executed

for number in range(10):
  print('hello world')


# the above code will print 'hello world' 10 times

for number in range(3,9):
  print(number)
  

# the range() function takes a minimum of 1 argument and up to 3, all must be integer values
# the above example will print 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
# the first argument, optional, determines where the count will start, if none is given 0 is the default
# the second argument, required, determines where the count will stop, **this value is not included in the count

for number in range(3,9,2):
  print(number)
  
 # the above example will print 3, 5, and 7
 # the third argument, if given, determines the steps or increments between numbers
 # if none is given, 1 is the default

for number in range(9,3,-1)
  print(number)

# you can also count down, this requires a larger integer, followed by a smaller integer and then a negative step value
# the above example will return 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
