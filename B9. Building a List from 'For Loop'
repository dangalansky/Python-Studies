## ----------- Building a List from 'For Loop'------------- ##

# for the next few lessons, we will be working towards building a password generator
# we will also be using a function from the random module, so we will need to import that
# this generator will start with pre-populated lists: letters, numbers, and symbols
# imagine these lists are long enough to contain every possible letter, number and symbol

import random

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4',  '5']
symbol = ['!', '#', '$', '%', '^', '*']


# we will start by asking the user how many letters, numbers and symbols they would like in their password
# these input values will be converted from strings to integers

user_letters = int(input('How many letters would you like?: ')
user_numbers = int(input('How many numbers would you like?: ')
user_symbols = int(input('How many symbols would you like?: ')

## ------------ For Loops and Building Lists --------------- ##

# at this point we have all the data we need
# we start by creating an empty list that will be populated by a 'for loop'

password = []

# the random module contains a function called choice()
# choice returns a random item from a list, tuple or string
# we will use it to return random letters, numbers and symbols from our list


for character in range(user_letters):
	password += random.choice(letters)
for character in range(user_numbers):
	password += random.choice(numbers)
for character in range(user_symbols):
	password += random.choice(symbols)

# now our list will be populated with a random assortment characters

print(password)
