## ----------------- Hangman with While Loop ----------------------- ##

# the main issue we have to address is the unability to continue guessing
# this can be addressed using a 'while loop'
# to begin, we will set a boolean that will begin as False

end_of_game = False

# now we place our program inside a condition that says, while it is not the end of game, continue running

while not end_of_game:
	for position in range(len(chosen_word)):
    letter = chosen_word[position]
    if letter == guess:
        display[position] = letter

	print(display)

# now we describe the conditions that would lead to a reversal of end_of_game
# namely, when there are no more blanks left in display

	if '_' not in display:
		end_of_game = True
		print('YOU WIN!')

# in an actual game of hangman, you do not have infinite guesses
# we will limit the guesses in our next lesson, to more fully resemble the actual game
