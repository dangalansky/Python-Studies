## ------------------------ Variables -------------------------- ##

# variables are user-created containers, that store values or data
## this is a way to shorten/simplify our code so we don't have to retype complicated values
### can reduce mistakes and improve readability to ourselves and others who use our code

name = "Dan Galansky"
print(name)

# The above example will return the string "Dan Galansky"

# values can be changed throughout the length of a program

name = "Dan Galansky"
name = "Dangle Ansky"
print(name)

# The above example will return the string "Dangle Ansky"
## Computers read code top to bottom and python is a dynamic language allowing variables to change
### Thus, the value the computer will assocaited with variable, 'name' is the last stated

# we can use concatenation to combine strings stored inside variables

name1 = Dan
name2 = Dangle
print(name1 + name2)

# this above example would return DanDangle

#Variables can also hold other data types such as integers

num = 6
print(num)

#the above example will return the integer 6
## note: you cannot concatenate integers
### thus, you can also not concatenate integers with strings

print(num + name1)

# The above example will return TypeError!!!!!

## ------------------------ Naming Variables -------------------------------- ##

# variables should be all lowercase
## spaces must designated by use of underscores (_)
### you cannot use python keywords or function names for variables
#### they must make sense to you and others reading your code so, choose wisely
