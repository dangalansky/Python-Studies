## ------------------------ Variables -------------------------- ##

# variables are user-created containers, that store values or data
# this is a way to shorten/simplify our code so we don't have to retype complicated values
# this will reduce mistakes and improve readability to ourselves and others who use our code

name = "Dan Galansky"
print(name)

# the above example will return the string "Dan Galansky"


# values can be changed throughout the length of a program
# code is read top to bottom and python is a dynamic language allowing variables to change
# thus, the value the computer will assocaite with a variable is the last stated


name = "Dan Galansky"
name = "Dangle Ansky"
print(name)


# above, you'll notice the same variable is used twice
# this example will return the string "Dangle Ansky"


# we can use concatenation to combine strings stored inside variables

name1 = Dan
name2 = Dangle
print(name1 + name2)

# this above example would return DanDangle

# variables can also any other data type such as integers

num = 6
print(num)

# the above example will return the integer 6
# note: you cannot concatenate integers
# it follows then that you can also not concatenate integers with strings

print(num + name1)

# The above example will return TypeError!!!!!


## ------------------------ Naming Variables/Python Etiquette -------------------------------- ##

# while you can get away with a lot, there are commonly accepted guidelines
# like any written language, grammar is important for mass communicability and understanding
# also there are a lot of mistakes you will avoid in the future by sticking to these:


# local variables should be all lowercase
# spaces must designated by use of underscores (_)
# python keywords cannot be used for function names or variables
# as your projects get more complex, your code will get long and it is intense to have to edit so...
# variables should make sense to you and others reading your code, choose wisely!
