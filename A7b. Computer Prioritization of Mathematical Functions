## ------------------------- Computer Priority of Mathematical Functions -------------------- ##

# to understand how a computer prioritizes mathematical functions, consider the following script:

print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)

# what would the answer be? 
# how does a computer decide to order these operations?
# left to right, seems logical...
# 3 * 3 = 9, + 3 = 12, / 3 = 4, - 3 = 1
# but 1 is not the answer!

## ------------------------- PEMDAS or PEMDASLR ---------------------------------------- ##

# the order of priority is as follows: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and divsion, addition and subtraction
# multiplication and division are of equal priority, in which case priority is given left to right or L to R
# the same applies to addition and subtraction, priority is given L to R

print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)

# 3 * 3 = 9, 3 /3 = 1 
# so: 9 + 1 - 3
# the actual answer here will be: 7.0

# mathematical operations always return a floating point!
