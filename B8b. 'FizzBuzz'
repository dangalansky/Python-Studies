## ------------------------- 'FizzBuzz' --------------------------- ##

# this is apparently a common interview question for coders
# FizzBuzz is a childrens game, played in a circle
# you count to 100, if your number is divible by 3 you instead say 'fizz'
 if your number is divisible by 5 you instead say 'buzz'
 for each number divisble by both, you say 'fizzbuzz'

for number in range (1, 101):
	if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
		print("FizzBuzz")
	elif number % 5 == 0:
		print("Buzz")
	elif number % 3 == 0:
		print("Fizz")
	else:
		print(number)
