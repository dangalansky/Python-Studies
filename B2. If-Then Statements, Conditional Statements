## -------------------------- If/Then Statements -------------------------------- ##

# if statements are used to check a that a condition is true
## when conditions are met, the command is executed

a = 50
if a > 20:
	print('Command Executed')
	
# note the formating above
## after an 'if' statement is made, a colon follows, line break and then 4 spaces before issuing command
## what happens if the condition is not met?

a = 50
if a > 50:
	print('Command Exectuted')
elif a == 50:
	print('This will have to do!')
	
# elif means 'else if'
# if the first 'if' statement has conditons that are not met, the computer continues on, top to bottom
# this continues until a condition is met, or if no condition is met the computer exits the block

a = 50
if a > 50:
	print('Command Executed')
elif a > 100:
	print('This is a big number')
else:
	print('Program Ended')

# the above statement uses an 'else'
## 'else' implies that no conditions were met but you still want a command to be executed
