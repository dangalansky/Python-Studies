## -------------- Intro to 'While Loops ---------------- ##

# a 'for loop' executes for the duration of a particular iteration.
# it tends to be more finite

# do item in list_of_items:
	#do something to each item
 

# while loops continue to execute while a particular condition remains True (or False)


# while something_is_true:
	#do something repeatedly
  
# example:

number_of_puppies = 15

while number_of_puppies > 10:
	adopt_dog()
	number_of_puppies -= 1

# you can use a 'while loop' to keep your program running by wrapping your code in a while loop
# your program will run until some specific condition occurs.
