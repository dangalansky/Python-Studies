## -------------- Intro to 'While Loops ---------------- ##

# a 'for loop' executes for the duration of a particular iteration
# the length of a string, list or range for example
# thus, they tend to be more finite

# for item in list_of_items:
	#do something to each item
 

# 'while loops' continue to execute while a particular condition (or lack thereof) remains True 


# while something_is_true:
	#do something repeatedly
  
# example:

number_of_puppies = 15

while number_of_puppies > 10:
	adopt_dog()
	number_of_puppies -= 1

# you can use a 'while loop' to keep your program running by nesting your code in a 'while loop'
# your program will run until some specific condition occurs. 
# we will see a great example of this when we build our hangman application
