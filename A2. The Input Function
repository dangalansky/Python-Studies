## ------------------- Inputs ---------------------- ##

# input() is a function that tells the computer to recieve a data from the user

name = input("What is your name?")

# in the above example, the computer will print the string "What is your name?" and await a user response
# what the user types, will essentially replace the previous value of that string
# name = whatever the use types!
# however, nothing will be done with that input unless instructed

print("Hello " + input("What is your name"))

# in the above example, the computer is awaiting a user input value before it can complete the print() function
# thus, "What is your name" will appear first, with a prompt for the user to return a value
# once the user enters a name, the computer will print "Hello Your Name"

#### TIP!! ####

# use '\n' at the end of an input for a line break before user reponse, like below:

name = input("What is your name?\n")
print(name)
