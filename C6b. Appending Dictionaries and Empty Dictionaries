## ---------------------- Adding Items to A Dictionary ----------------------- ##

# we have a pre-defined dictionary called 'programming_dictionary'
# lets add a key/value pair
# to do this, we state the name of the dictionary we are appending, followed by the new key and value, like so:

programming_dictionary["loop"] = "the action of doing something repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied"

## ---------------------- Redefining a Key ------------------------------ ##

# similar to how we add items, we can also redefine pre-existing keys in our dictionary
# the form is the same, simply state the dictionary, key and place the new value you wish to pair with it

programming_dictionary["bug"] = "something completely different"


## ----------------------- The Empty Dictionary -------------------------- ##

# an empty dictionary would like this:

programming_dictionary = {}

# if we were to place this further down in the code than our previous actions, it would empty the dictionary
# but this can also be useful for creating an empty space to populate with data later on!
