## --------------------- Introducing Modules ----------------------- ##

# modules are pre-packaged code that are either "inbuilt" in python, or imported from outside sources
# inbuilt means the module comes pre-installed within a python library

# modules serve to simplify and shorten code
# otherwise there would be too much to handle
