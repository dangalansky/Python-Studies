## --------------------- Introducing Modules ----------------------- ##

# modules are pre-packaged code that are either "inbuilt" in python, or imported from outside
## inbuilt means the module comes pre-downloaded inside the basic python library

# modules serve to simply and shorten code
## otherwise there would be too much to handle
