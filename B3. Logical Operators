## -------------------- Logical Operators --------------------- ##

# logical operators allow to check for multiple conditions within the same line of code
# the logical operators are 'and', 'or', and 'not'.

## -------------------- AND --------------------- ##

# 'and' means all conditions must be true

a = 15

if a > 10 and a % 2 == 0:
	print('Conditions Met')
else:
	print('Conditions are not met')

# in the above example, 'Conditions are not met' would be printed because both conditions were not true
# 15 is greater than 10, but 15 is not evenly divisible by 2

## -------------------- OR --------------------- ##

# 'or' means only one condition has to be true

a = 15

if a > 10 or a % 2 == 0:
	print('Conditions Met')

# in the above example, 'Conditions met' would be printed
# 15 is greater than 10 and not evenly divisible by 2 
#but ONLY ONE has to be true for the statement to be printed

## -------------------- NOT --------------------- ##

# 'not' reverses a condition, or checks for its opposite

a = 15 

if a not < 10:
	print('Condition met')
	
# in the above example, 'Condition met' would be printed
# 15 is indeed greater than 10 so it is NOT less than 10
