## ------------------------- Mathematical Operations -------------------------------- ##

# when performing a mathematical funtion in python, use the following guide:

# + for addition
# - for subtraction
# / for division
# * for multiplication
# ** for exponents

two_digit_number = input("Type a two-digit number: ")
number1 = int(two_digit_number[0])
number2 = int(two_digit_number[1])
print(number1 + number2)

# the above example, adds the two integers of a two-digit number together
## one would simply need to replace the '+' in the final print statement with any of the above operators to change to multiplication, division, etc.
