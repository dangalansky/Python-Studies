## ----------------- Defining Functions --------------------- ##

# functions are like machines made of code that execute specific tasks for a desired outcome 
# over the course of our coding lives, we will need to define countless functions for our programs
# in order to create or 'define' a function, we first start by typing the keyword 'def'
# def is followed by the name of your function, ostensibly something that describes what it does
# what a function is called, is completely up to the developer
# remember: variables should make sense to someone who knows nothing about your code
# a function name is traditionally lower case, cannot have capitols and is followed by a set of parentheses and a colon

def function_name():
	print('Hey There')
	print('Lovely People')
	

	
# the above code, once called, would print 'Hey There' and 'Lovely People' on 2 seperate lines in the console
# to call a function, you simply type its name followed by a set of parentheses
# some functions require an argument to be placed inside the parentheses such as the len() function and print()
