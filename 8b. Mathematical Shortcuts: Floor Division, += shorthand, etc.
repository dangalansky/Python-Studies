## --------------------- Floor Division ---------------------------- ##

# to automatically return a rounded integer, one can perform floor division functions
## floor division is signified through the use of a double forward slash or '//'

print(8//3)

# the above example will return: 2

## -------------------- Other shortcuts! --------------------------- ##

# to manuipulate a previous numerical value, one can use a mathematical operator in conjunction with an '='
## examples: +=, -=, /=, *=

score = 0
score += 1

# the above example shows how to use this form of shorthand
## now score = 1 and every time this code is passed, another 1 is added to the previous score
### this can be repeated with any of the previously introduced mathematical operators
