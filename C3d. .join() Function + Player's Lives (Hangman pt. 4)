## ------------------- Adding the 'Lives' Element to Hangman ----------------------- ##

# in order to limit the amount of incorrect attempts a player has, we will create a variable called 'lives'
# let's give the lives to 6

lives = 6

# now we set a condition, where the lives will lower by 1 each time a guess is incorrect

if guess not in chosen_word:
  lives -= 1
    if lives == 0:
      end_of_game = True
      print('Game Over. You Lose!')
      
## ----------------- Converting List to String ------------------- ##

# a final step to improve the UI experience would be to make display show itself as a string
# using .join() converts the string to a list as long as the list items are the same datatype

print(' '.join(display))

# the above command takes the list, 'display' and converts it to a string
# the space in quotes tells the computer to seperate the items by a space 
# you can instead put anything inside those quotes, say a '#' for instance
