## ------------------- Understanding Proper Use of Equal Signs -------------------- ##

# a single '=' is used to ASSIGN a value to a variable 

single = 1

# a double '==' is used to confirm/check the EQUALITY of 2 seperate values
# usually used in if/else statements

if single == 1:
  #do something

# there's also use of '=' with the symbols: 'greater than', 'less than', 'equal to', or 'not equal to'
# in these cases the '=' always comes after the signifying symbol

#    >=: greater than or equal to
#    >=: less than or equal to
#    ==: equal to
#    !=: not equal to
