## ------------------- Understanding Proper Use of Equal Signs -------------------- ##

# a single '=' is used to assign a value to a variable 

single = 1

# a double '==' is used to confirm/check the equality of 2 values
## usually used in if/else statements

if single == 1:
  #do something

# there's also use of '=' with greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to
## in this case the '=' always comes after the signifying symbol

#    >=: greater than or equal to
#    >=: less than or equal to
#    ==: equal to
#    !=: not equal to
