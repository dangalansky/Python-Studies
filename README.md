# Python-Studies
I will be taking you with me through my process of learning to code using Python.

This repository will be used to regurgitate the information I am currently taking in through my studies. 

Most of it will be simple and some of it may be incorrect. 

That said, I welcome constructive criticism and corrections.

Anyone is welcome to steal, use or otherwise affect the items contained within this repository as they see fit. 

Thank you for taking the time to visit this repository.

Happy Coding!
