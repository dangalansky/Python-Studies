# Python-Studies
I will be taking you with me through my process of learning to code using Python.

This repository will be used to regurgitate the information I am currently taking in through my studies. 

Most of it will be simple and some of it may be incorrect. 

That said, I welcome constructive criticism, corrections as well as anyone to use this infomation as they see fit.

Thank you for taking the time to visit this repository.

Happy Coding!
