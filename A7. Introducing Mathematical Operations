## ------------------------- Mathematical Operations ----------------------- ##

# when performing a mathematical funtion in python, use the following guide:

#     + for addition
#     - for subtraction
#     / for division
#     * for multiplication
#     ** for exponents

two_digit_number = input("Type a two-digit number: ")
number1 = int(two_digit_number[0])
number2 = int(two_digit_number[1])
print(number1 + number2)

# the above example, adds the two integers of a two-digit number together
# one would simply need to replace the '+' in the final print statement with any of the above operators to change to multiplication, division, etc. 

## -------------------------- The Modulo Operator ------------------------- ##

# '%' is called a modulo
# it divides an 2 numbers and returns only the remainder

a = 4 % 2
print(a)

# in the above example we would recieve 0, because there is no remainder when we divide 4 by 2

a = 4 % 3
b = 5 % 3
print(a)

# in the above example a = 1, because 3 goes into 4 once with 1 remaining
# b = 2 because 3 goes into 5 once, with 2 remaining
