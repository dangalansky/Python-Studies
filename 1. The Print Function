## ----------------- The Print Function ------------------- ##

# Functions are code modules that complete a given task
##The most basic function we can call is the print() function

# print() returns a value in the consule, depending on what is put inside the parentheses 

print("Hello World")


# In this above example, what would appear in the console, after running your code would be: Hello World
## "Hello World" is a string, or ordered set of characters
## A string is a data type
## Strings are differentiated from code or other data types through the use of quotation marks
## Python treats single and double quotation marks as the same

### "I am a string"

### 'I am also a string'

# If we want to print something in quotes, we must use the opposite of whatever kind we are using for the print() function

print('print("what to print")')
print("print('what to print')")

# If we forget the quotes, we will return a SyntaxError:

print(Hello World)

#### Comment out the above line to return "Hello World" without an error

## ------------------- Line Breaks ---------------------- ##

# if we want code to appear on a new line, insert '/n' inside quotes

print("Hello World\nHello World\nHello World\n")


## ------------------- String Concatenation --------------------- ##

# we can also merge seperate strings into a single string through the use of '+'
## this is referred to as string concatenation
## seperate strings must be self contained within their own set of quotation marks

print("Hello" + "User")
