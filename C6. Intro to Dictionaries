## ---------------- Intro To Dictionaries --------------------- ##

# dictionaries are signified by the use of curly brackets: {}
# within the curly brakets, related pieces of information are grouped together

# proper formatting:

programming_dictionary: {
  "bug" : "an error in a program",
  "function" : "a piece of code that can be easily recalled",
}

# there are two parts to a dictionary entry: the KEY and the VALUE
# in the above example, BUG = the key, AN ERROR IN A PROGRAM = the value

* note that the value is followed by a comma!

## --------------- Recalling a Value From a Dictionary ----------- ##

# to recall a value from a dictionary, simply state the name of the dictionary followed by the key inside quotes, inside square brackets

ex) to receive value:

print(programming_dictionary["bug"])

return: an error in a program
