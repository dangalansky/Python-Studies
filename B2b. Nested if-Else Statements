## --------------------- Nested If/Else Statements ------------------------ ##

a = 50

if a >= 50:
  if a % 2 == 0:
    print ('This is an even number')
  
# The above statement checks for whether a variable contains an even number using the modulo operator
## But this only happens if the previous condition is met
### This is called nesting!

a = 5

if a > 1:
  if a % 2 == 0:
    print('This is an even number')
  elif a % 3 == 0:
    print ('This number is divisible by 3')
  else:
    print('Nah, friend. This won't work!')


# in the above example, a = 5 so it is greater than 1
## but, 5 is not evenly divisible by 2 so it will pass on to the next statement
### 5 is also not divisible by 3
#### this will return a statement: Nah, friend, This won't work!
