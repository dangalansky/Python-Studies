## -------------------------- If/Else Statements -------------------------------- ##


# an if/else statements checks wheter a condition is true or false
# if a condition is true then a specific block of code is executed


a = 50

if a > 20:
	print('Command Executed')
	
# note the formating above
# after an 'if' statement is made, a colon follows, a line break, and then 4 spaces before issuing command
# what happens if the condition is not met?

a = 50

if a > 50:
	print('Command Exectuted')
elif a == 50:
	print('This will have to do!')
	
# elif means 'else if'
# if the first 'if' statement has conditons that are not met, the computer continues on, top to bottom
# this continues until a condition is met, or if no condition is met, the computer exits the code block

a = 50

if a > 50:
	print('Command Executed')
elif a > 100:
	print('This is a big number')
else:
	print('Program Ended')

# the above statement uses an 'else'
# 'else' is used to tell the computer what to do in the case that no conditions are met
