## --------------------------- For Loops -------------------------- ##

# loops allow the same line of code to be executed multiple times
## for loops iterate over a string, list, dictionary or otherwise ordered code property
### for each iteration, a line of code is executed that involves the item involved
list = []

for letter in string:
    list.append(letter)

print(list)

# in the above example, the 'for loop' iterates over each character in the string 'hello'
## for each letter, the next line of code is executed
### this line adds each letter to the empty list, 'list'
