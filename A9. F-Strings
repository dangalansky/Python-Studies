## --------------------------------- Introducing F-Strings ---------------------------- ##

# f-strings allow us to incorporate different data types within a string expression
## this is designated by placing an 'f' before the quotes and placing the  variables inside curly brackets or '{}'

score = 17
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
print(f'Your score is: {score}, your height is {height}m, it is {isWinning} that you are winning')

# the above example would return this following line:
## Your score is: 17, your height is 1.8m, it is True that you are winning

# f-strings are an easy way to bypass formal data conversion
