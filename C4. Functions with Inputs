## -------------------- Functions with Inputs ------------------ ##

def say_hello(name):
	print(f'Hello {name}!)


# the above function requires an input to complete its execution
# in this case the variable 'name' is referred to as a 'parameter'
# the data a user inserts into its place is referred to as an 'argument'

say_hello(Susan)

# the above function would print: Hello Susan!

# a function can have unlimited parameters

def say_hello(name, location):
	print(f'Hello {name}!)
	print(f'Welcome to {location}')


# by default, these arguments are positional
# that means, the position within the parentheses determines what parameter the argument represents

say_hello(Susan, Denver)

#the above function call would return: Hello Susuan! Welcome to Denver
# if we reversed the order, here's what it would look like

say_hello(Denver, Susuan)

# this above function call would return: Hellow Denver! Welcome to Susan
# we could instead insert 'keyword arguments' which allows the order to be irrelevant

say_hello(location=Denver, name=Susan)

# This would return the originally intended statement: Hello Susan! Welcome to Denver
