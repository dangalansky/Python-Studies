## -------------------- Rounding Mathematical Operations ----------------------- ##

# mathematical operations return a float by default
# what if you just want a whole number, or integer?

print(8/3)

# the above example will return 2.6666 by default

print(int(8/3))

# this above example will return 2
# int() returns everything on the left side of the decimal
# this works but sacrifices accuracy 

print(round(8/3))

# the round() function is also a solution
# left alone, this would return: 3
# round() rounds up if > 5 or down if <= 5

print(round(8/3, 2))

# round() takes a second (optional) argument 
# an integer that specifies how many decimal places to round to
# the higher or lower than 5 rule still applies
# this will return: 2.67
