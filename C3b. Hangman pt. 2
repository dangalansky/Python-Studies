## ------------------- Hangman Pt. 2 -------------------------- ##

# in the last lesson, we were able to check the user response against the random word
# however, we were returned a very awkward-looking response from the computer
# let's make the response from the computer look more similar to an IRL version of the game

import random
word_bank = ['acupuncture', 'backbone', 'cranberry', 'dinosaur', 'elephant']
chosen_word = random.choice(word_bank)

# after the computer has chosen a word at random, we will populate a list with blanks for each letter of that word

display = []

for _ in range(len(chosen_word)):
	display += "_"

# above, we have used a 'for loop' in conjunction with the .range() function and the .len() function
# this populates the list with the correct number of blank spaces

guess = input('Guess a letter:' ).lower()


for position in range(len(chosen_word)):
    letter = chosen_word[position]
    if letter == guess:
        display[position] = letter

print(display)

# if the computer randomly chooses 'dinosaur' and the user guesses 'A', this will return:

# ['_', '_', '_', '_', '_', a, '_', '_',]

# again, the program ends here, bc there is no further instruction given. 
# next lesson, we will address this with a 'while loop'.
