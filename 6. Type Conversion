## ----------------- Type Conversion -------------------- ##

# through the use of proper abbreviation and parentheses, one can convert values to specific data types to overcome compatibility issues
## ex)

number_of_characters = len(input("What is your name?"))
print(type(number_of_characters))

# in the above example, after the user inputs their name, the computer will return: <class 'int'>
## because, while the input is a string, the len() function returns an integer
### the first line of code is set to determine how long a name is

new_num_char = str(number_of_characters)
print(new_num_char)
print(type(new_num_char))

# in the above example, the computer will return a number and <class 'str'>
## while an integer will be shown, it will actually be a string because we converted in to one
