## ------------------- Inputs ---------------------- ##

# input() is a function that tells the computer to recieve a data input from the user

input("What is your name?)

# in the above example, the computer will return the string "What is your name?" and await a user response
## what the user types, will essentially replace the previous value of that string
### nothing will be done with that input until instructed!

print("Hello " + input("What is your name"))

# in the above example, the computer is awaiting a user input value before it can complete the print() function
## thus, "What is your name" will appear first, with a prompt for the user to return a value
### lastly, the computer will return Hello 'User Input'
