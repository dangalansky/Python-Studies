## ----------------- The Print Function ------------------- ##

# functions are blocks of code that complete a given task
# data is passed into a function to return a specific output
# to 'call the function' is to bring it into being, we 'call' a function when we type its name
# the most introductory function we can call is the print() function

# print() returns a value in the consule, depending on what is put inside the parentheses 

print("Hello World")


# in the above example, what would appear in the console, after running your code would be: Hello World
# "Hello World" is a string, or ordered set of characters
# a string is a data type
# strings are differentiated from code or other data types through the use of quotation marks
# python treats single and double quotation marks as the same

string = "I am a string"

string =  'I am also a string'

# if we want to print something in quotes, we must use the opposite of whatever we are using inside the print() function
# to be more specific, double quotes must be differentiated from single quotes

print('print("what to print")')
print("print('what to print')")

# if one forgets the quotes, we will return a SyntaxError:

print(Hello World)

# comment out the above line to return "Hello World" without an error

## ------------------- Line Breaks ---------------------- ##

# if we want to insert a line break, insert '\n' inside quotes where the new line should start

print("Hello World\nHello World\nHello World\n")


## --------------- String Concatenation ----------------- ##

# we can also merge seperate strings into a single string through the use of '+'
# this is referred to as 'string concatenation'
# seperate strings must be self contained within their own set of quotation marks

print("Hello" + "User")

## ------------------- Spaces Between Words --------------------- ##

# spaces within a single string will translate as long as they are inside the quotation marks

print("Spaces will translate inside the quotes!")

# if we want to add a space between strings, you can add another string that is just a space, like so: " "

print("We can also add a space" "  " "between strings!")
