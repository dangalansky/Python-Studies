## --------------------------- Subscripts -------------------------- ##

# a quick note:
# we can pull out individual characters from strings and individual values from lists
# we do this through the use of subscripts, or a set of square brackets with an integer in the middle
# this is referred to as 'indexing'

my_string = "Hello"
print(my_string[0])
print(my_string[2])

# in the above example, the computer will return 'H' and 'l'
# computers count from 0 so the first letter will always be 0
