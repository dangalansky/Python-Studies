## -------------------- Even Number Checker ---------------------- ##

def even_number_check(number):
	is_odd = True
	for _ in range (2, number):

 # the above code is a great example of boolean usage
 # since 0 and 1 are of no interest, we start the range at 2
 # we assume the number is odd until otherwise proven
 # if that number, when divided by 2 using the modulo operator, leaves no remainder, it is even
