## -------------------- The Random Module --------------------- ##

# below we see the common way to bring a module into our code

import random
random_integer = random.randint(1,10)
print(random_integer)

# random is an in-built module that contains many functions that serve to randomize data
# to access functions within a module, name the module followed by a '.', the function name, and a set of parentheses
# not all functions require inputs, but those that do go inside the parentheses

from random import *
random_integer = randint(1,10)
print(random_integer)

# when one will be using a module frequently or even many different functions from the module, it saves time to import everything
# this is indicated by the use of an asterisk
# in this case one would not need to reference the module at all, functions can be called on their own

# one can also import a specific function from a module

from random import randint
print(randint(1,10)

# the above 2 examples will return a random integer from 1 to 10
# this particular function includes the latter integer but not all do!

random_float = random.random()
print(random_float)

# the above function, random(), returns a floating point between 0 and 1
# but...this range does not include 0 OR 1
# to get a random float above 1, multiply by your upper limit

random_float = random.random() * 5
