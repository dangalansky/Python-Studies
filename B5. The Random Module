# the random module is an inbuilt module that contains many functions that randomize data
## to access functions within a module, name the module followed by a '.', the function name and a set of parentheses
### not all functions require inputs, but those that do go inside the parentheses

# when one will be using a module frequently or even many items from the module, it saves time to import everything
## this is indicated by the use of an asterisk
### one can also import a specific function from a module

# the above examples will return a random integer from 1 to 10
## this particular function includes the latter integer but not all do!
