## ------------------- Hangman Pt1 -------------------------##

# we will now build an app, based on hangman
# the app involves a word bank, pre-populated with words
# one of which will be chosen at random using the choice() function

import random

word_bank = ['acupuncture', 'backbone', 'cranberry', 'dinosaur', 'elephant']
chosen_word = random.choice(word_bank)

guess = input('Guess a letter:' ).lower()

# we are now asking the user to imput a letter to guess
# the .lower() function takes a string and returns all lowercase letters
# this is particularly important when 'A' is considered a different character than 'a'

for letter in chosen_word:
    if letter == guess:
        print('correct')
    else:
        print('wrong')

# the above 'for loop' cycles through every letter of the randomly chosen word and checks it against the user letter
# if we were to guess 'A' to begin and the word was dinosaur, we would recieve this in response:

# wrong
# wrong
# wrong
# wrong
# wrong
# correct
# wrong
# wrong

# unfortunately, this is where the program ends because that's all the code says to do
# in order to keep the program running, we need a 'while loop'
