## -------------------- The Length Function ------------------------- ##

# len() is used to represent the length function
# the length function returns an integer value
# the integer tells how long a string, list or other data type is


print(len(input("What is your name")))

# the above example will execute thusly:

    ## "What is your name?"
    ## User: Dan
    ## Return: 3

# my name is Dan, Dan has 3 characters
# thus, the computer returns the integer 3

# integers or 'int' are another data type
# they are represented by a whole number, without quotation marks, and without decimals
